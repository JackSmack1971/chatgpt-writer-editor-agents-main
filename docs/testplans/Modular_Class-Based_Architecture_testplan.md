# Test Plan: Modular Class-Based Architecture

## 1. Introduction

This test plan defines the testing approach, strategy, and detailed test cases for the "Modular Class-Based Architecture" feature of the ChatGPT Writer/Editor Agent System. The plan is based on the feature specification, architecture document, knowledge gaps analysis, and research findings. It aims to ensure requirements traceability, robust test coverage, and support for acceptance test planning.

## 2. Test Scope

### In Scope
- Refactored modular, class-based architecture with at least four core classes: `Chatbot`, `OpenAIClient`, `ConversationManager`, `ConfigManager`.
- Asynchronous OpenAI API handling and robust error management.
- Memory modules (buffer and vector store), prompt template management, and persistent conversation logging.
- Secure configuration and environment management.
- Full unit and integration test coverage, including use of mocks for API and environment.
- Extensibility for new agent types, memory modules, and conversation flows.

### Out of Scope (V1)
- Web or GUI interface.
- Support for non-GPT models.
- Real-time multi-user support.
- Integration with external databases or message brokers.
- Advanced NLP customization beyond prompt engineering.

## 3. Test Strategy

### 3.1 Test Types
- **Unit Tests:** For all core classes, methods, and modules.
- **Integration Tests:** For interactions between classes (e.g., agent and memory, conversation orchestration). Integration and error-handling tests must use the real implementation classes (not local dummy classes) to ensure true validation of class interactions and error paths, as established in the latest implementation cycle.
- **Async Tests:** For all asynchronous operations using `pytest-asyncio`.
- **Mocked API Tests:** Using mock/fake LLMs and error simulation for offline and deterministic testing.
- **Negative Tests:** For error handling, invalid inputs, and failure scenarios.
- **Boundary Tests:** For memory windowing, message limits, and configuration extremes.
- **Extensibility Tests:** For adding new agent types, memory modules, and conversation topologies.
- **Security Tests:** For configuration and secret management.

### 3.2 Test Tools
- `pytest`, `pytest-asyncio`
- `unittest.mock` for API and environment mocking
- Fake LLMs (e.g., `FakeListLLM`)
- Environment variable and time mocking utilities

#### Integration Test Fixture Policy
- All integration and error-handling tests must import and use the actual implementation classes (e.g., from `chatbot.py`, `config_manager.py`) rather than local dummy class definitions. This ensures that changes in the real codebase are reflected in test outcomes and supports accurate validation of integration logic and error handling.

### 3.3 Requirements Traceability
Each test case is mapped to specific requirements and architecture constraints to ensure full coverage and support for acceptance test planning.

## 5. Test Data Requirements

- Sample configuration files and environment variable sets (including invalid/missing cases).
- Test isolation and teardown data: Ensure that environment variables, file system state, and persistent logs are properly isolated and cleaned up between tests to prevent side effects and ensure reproducibility.
- Mock API responses (success, error, rate limit, malformed).
- Sample prompt templates (valid, invalid, partial, few-shot, pipeline).
- Example conversation logs (for replay and persistence tests).
- Large and small message sets for boundary testing.

---

## 6. Test Environment

- Python 3.x
- `pytest`, `pytest-asyncio`
- `unittest.mock`
- `python-dotenv` or equivalent for environment management
- Local file system access for logging and config
- No external API calls required for unit tests (all API calls mocked)
- Integration tests may require valid OpenAI API key (marked separately)
- Test isolation and teardown: All tests, especially those manipulating environment variables or persistent state, must ensure proper setup and cleanup to avoid cross-test contamination. This is critical for reliable CI/CD and accurate integration test results.

## 8. Open Questions, Assumptions, and Risks

### Open Questions (from knowledge gaps)
- What are the practical performance limits of in-memory vector stores for long-running/multi-user scenarios?
- What are best practices for dynamic/pluggable conversation topologies and orchestration?
- How should prompt template versioning and experimentation be managed in collaborative environments?
- What are robust patterns for distributed API rate limit coordination under high concurrency?
- What are the current limitations of async test coverage and mocking tools for complex agent systems?
- What are the most secure patterns for API key management, secret rotation, and audit logging in local/dev Python projects?

### Assumptions
- All core classes will expose clear, testable interfaces.
- All async operations will be implemented using `asyncio` and compatible with `pytest-asyncio`.
- Mocking and patching will be feasible for all external dependencies.
- Persistent logging will use the local file system.

### Risks
- Some knowledge gaps may limit the completeness of automated tests (e.g., memory scalability, distributed rate limiting).
- Async and concurrency issues may be difficult to fully simulate in unit tests.
- Security best practices for local/dev environments may evolve, requiring future updates to tests.

- 100% code coverage is achieved (unit and integration).
- All async and error handling paths are tested, including with mocks.
- Extensibility and modularity are validated by adding/swapping modules in tests.

## 11. Continuous Improvement

- The test harness and fixtures must be continuously reviewed and refactored to ensure that all integration and error-handling tests use the real implementation classes, not local dummies. This is essential for maintaining true integration coverage and supporting ongoing TDD cycles.
- Test isolation, especially for environment variables and persistent state, should be regularly audited to prevent side effects and ensure test reliability.

This test plan should be updated as new knowledge gaps are resolved, requirements evolve, or additional best practices are identified. All test cases and strategies should be reviewed regularly for completeness and relevance.
