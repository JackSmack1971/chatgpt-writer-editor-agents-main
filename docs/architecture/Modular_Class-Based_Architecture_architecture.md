# Modular Class-Based Architecture: High-Level Design

## Overview

This document defines the high-level architecture for the "Modular Class-Based Architecture" feature of the refactored ChatGPT Writer/Editor Agent System. The design is informed by project requirements, best practices in modular object-oriented (OO) agent design, and identified knowledge gaps. The architecture aims to deliver a maintainable, extensible, and scalable Python system that supports robust agent conversations, secure configuration, and future feature growth.

## Architectural Modules and Responsibilities

### 1. `Chatbot` Class

**Responsibility:**  
Encapsulates agent logic, manages conversation history, and interfaces with memory modules and prompt templates.

**Key Features:**
- Maintains in-memory conversation window (buffer) and supports persistent logging.
- Integrates with both buffer and vector store memory for context-aware and semantic recall.
- Exposes methods for sending/receiving messages, updating memory, and interacting with prompt templates.
- No global state; all agent state is instance-based.

**Interfaces:**
- Accepts an `OpenAIClient` instance for API calls.
- Accepts memory module(s) (buffer, vector store).
- Accepts prompt template(s) (decoupled from logic).

---

### 2. `OpenAIClient` Class

**Responsibility:**  
Abstracts all interactions with the OpenAI GPT API, handling asynchronous requests, error management, and rate limiting.

**Key Features:**
- Provides async methods for sending prompts and receiving completions.
- Handles API rate limits, retries, and error conditions robustly.
- Supports mocking for offline and test scenarios.
- Loads API keys securely from configuration.

**Interfaces:**
- Exposes async methods for prompt completion.
- Accepts configuration from `ConfigManager`.

---

### 3. `ConversationManager` Class

**Responsibility:**  
Orchestrates multi-agent conversations, manages conversation flows, and supports advanced topologies (e.g., turn-taking, group debate).

**Key Features:**
- Manages multiple `Chatbot` instances and their interactions.
- Supports session/thread-based memory for concurrent conversations.
- Implements state graph or pluggable topology patterns for extensibility.
- Handles persistent logging of conversation history.

**Interfaces:**
- Accepts a list of `Chatbot` instances.
- Exposes methods for starting, routing, and managing conversations.
- Integrates with memory and logging modules.

---

### 4. `ConfigManager` Class

**Responsibility:**  
Securely loads and manages configuration values and secrets (e.g., API keys, environment variables).

**Key Features:**
- Loads configuration from environment variables or config files (e.g., `.env`).
- Provides secure access to secrets for other modules.
- Supports secret rotation and audit logging (future extension).

**Interfaces:**
- Exposes methods for retrieving configuration values.
- Used by `OpenAIClient` and other modules requiring config/secrets.

---

### 5. Memory Modules

**Responsibility:**  
Provide in-memory buffer and vector store memory for agents, supporting both short-term and semantic recall.

**Key Features:**
- Buffer memory for recent message windowing.
- Vector store memory for semantic search and long-term recall.
- Memory checkpointing for persistence across sessions.

**Interfaces:**
- Used by `Chatbot` and `ConversationManager`.
- Exposes methods for storing, retrieving, and pruning memories.

---

### 6. Prompt Template Management

**Responsibility:**  
Manages prompt templates, versioning, and experimentation, decoupled from agent logic.

**Key Features:**
- Stores and retrieves prompt templates.
- Supports versioning and A/B testing (future extension).
- Enables collaborative prompt development.

**Interfaces:**
- Used by `Chatbot` for dynamic prompt construction.

---

## Key Architectural Patterns and Decisions

- **Separation of Concerns:** Each class/module has a single, well-defined responsibility.
- **Composition over Inheritance:** Modules interact via clear interfaces, supporting extensibility.
- **Asynchronous Operations:** All API calls and I/O are async, leveraging `asyncio`.
- **No Global State:** All state is encapsulated within class instances.
- **Testability:** All modules are independently testable, with support for mocking and 100% test coverage.
- **Extensibility:** New agent types, memory modules, and conversation flows can be added with minimal refactoring.
- **Security:** No hardcoded secrets; all sensitive data is loaded securely.

---

## Data Flow and Interactions

1. **Initialization:**  
   - `ConfigManager` loads configuration and secrets.
   - `OpenAIClient` is initialized with config.
   - `Chatbot` instances are created, each with their own memory modules and prompt templates.
   - `ConversationManager` is initialized with a set of `Chatbot` instances.

2. **Conversation Flow:**  
   - `ConversationManager` orchestrates message passing between `Chatbot` instances.
   - Each `Chatbot` uses its memory modules to construct context-aware prompts.
   - Prompts are sent asynchronously via `OpenAIClient`.
   - Responses are processed, memory is updated, and conversation history is logged.

3. **Testing:**  
   - All classes are covered by unit and integration tests using `pytest` and mock clients.

## Open Questions and Risks

The following knowledge gaps and risks have been identified and require further research or validation:

- **Agent Memory Scalability:**  
  Performance limits of in-memory vector stores for long-running or multi-user scenarios; need for sharding, pruning, or offloading strategies.
- **Advanced Conversation Topologies:**  
  Best practices for dynamic/pluggable conversation flows and orchestration patterns.
- **Prompt Template Management:**  
  Effective strategies for versioning, A/B testing, and collaborative prompt development.
- **API Rate Limit Handling:**  
  Robust distributed rate limit coordination and fallback strategies under high concurrency.
- **Async Testing Tooling:**  
  Limitations in async test coverage and mocking for complex agent systems.
- **Security for API Keys:**  
  Best practices for secret rotation and audit logging in local/dev Python projects.

## Technology Choices

- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Async Framework:** `asyncio`
- **Testing:** `pytest`, `pytest-asyncio`
- **Environment Management:** `python-dotenv` or similar
- **API:** OpenAI GPT-4

## Summary and Next Steps

This architecture defines a modular, class-based foundation for the ChatGPT Writer/Editor Agent System, supporting maintainability, extensibility, and scalability. The design is informed by best practices in agent modeling and memory management, and explicitly addresses key risks and open questions. The next steps are detailed class/interface design, implementation, and continuous validation against the outlined success metrics.
