**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-05-17
**Prepared For:** AI Agent Swarm (Initial Processing by @orchestrator-project-initialization)
**Human Contact:** \[Placeholder: Project Lead, [contact@example.com](mailto:contact@example.com)]

## 1. Introduction & Vision

### 1.1. Project Overview

This project aims to refactor a monolithic Python prototype that simulates a conversation between two GPT-4-based personas ("Miss Writer" and "Mr. Editor") into a modular, maintainable, and scalable architecture.

### 1.2. Problem Statement / Opportunity

The current implementation, while functional, lacks modularity, scalability, and robust error handling, making it unsuitable for production or extension. There is an opportunity to architect a cleaner, testable, and extensible agent conversation system.

### 1.3. Core Vision

Enable a modular, extensible, and production-grade agent conversation framework built on GPT-4.

## 2. Project Goals & Objectives

### 2.1. Strategic Goals

* Goal 1: Transform the monolithic script into a modular, object-oriented design.
* Goal 2: Implement scalable, testable, and resilient API interaction.
* Goal 3: Enable flexible conversation flows and reusable agent definitions.

### 2.2. Specific Objectives (V1 / Initial Release)

* Objective 1.1: Refactor code into class-based structure with SRP-aligned components within 4 weeks.
* Objective 1.2: Implement async API interactions and robust error handling.
* Objective 1.3: Add unit and integration tests for all major components.

## 3. Scope

### 3.1. In Scope (Key Deliverables & Functionalities for V1)

* Modular class definitions (`Chatbot`, `OpenAIClient`, `ConversationManager`, etc.)
* Secure configuration management and environment-based API keys
* Asynchronous OpenAI API call handling
* Conversation history management with windowing and file I/O
* Basic test suite using `pytest`

### 3.2. Out of Scope (For V1)

* Web or GUI interface
* Support for non-GPT models
* Real-time multi-user support
* Integration with external databases or message brokers
* Advanced NLP customization beyond prompt engineering

## 4. Target Users & Audience

* **Primary User Persona 1: Developer/AI Researcher**

  * *Needs:* Maintainable codebase, modular structure
  * *Pain Points:* Monolithic scripts, hardcoded values, difficult testing

* **Primary User Persona 2: Technical Product Owner**

  * *Needs:* Reliable prototype for showcasing agent interactions
  * *Pain Points:* Instability, lack of configurability, missing documentation

## 5. Core Features & High-Level Requirements (V1)

### 5.1. Feature: Modular Class-Based Architecture

* **Description:** Refactor monolithic script into clear, reusable classes with single responsibilities.
* **High-Level Requirements/User Stories:**

  * As a developer, I want a `Chatbot` class to manage each agent's logic and history.
  * As a developer, I want an `OpenAIClient` class to abstract all GPT API interactions.
* **Priority:** Must-Have

### 5.2. Feature: Asynchronous API Calls

* **Description:** Enable `async`/`await` based OpenAI API requests for better concurrency.
* **High-Level Requirements/User Stories:**

  * As a system, I should fetch GPT responses asynchronously to improve throughput.
  * As a developer, I want structured error handling around async operations.
* **Priority:** Must-Have

### 5.3. Feature: Secure and Configurable Environment

* **Description:** Eliminate hardcoded values; load API keys and settings securely and flexibly.
* **High-Level Requirements/User Stories:**

  * As a developer, I want to load config values from `.env` or structured config files.
  * As a system, I must ensure API keys are not exposed in source files.
* **Priority:** Must-Have

### 5.4. Feature: Conversation Windowing and Persistence

* **Description:** Retain only a configurable number of past messages in memory while persisting full logs.
* **High-Level Requirements/User Stories:**

  * As a system, I want to keep memory usage low by limiting in-memory history.
  * As a user, I want full logs saved to disk for future review.
* **Priority:** Should-Have

### 5.5. Feature: Testing Suite with Mock API

* **Description:** Provide unit and integration tests for key components.
* **High-Level Requirements/User Stories:**

  * As a developer, I want to run offline tests using a mock GPT client.
  * As a product owner, I want assurance that features are regression-tested.
* **Priority:** Should-Have

## 6. Critical Constraints & Assumptions

### 6.1. Constraints

* **Technical:** OpenAI API rate limits and latency
* **Operational:** System designed for local/development use initially
* **Legal/Compliance:** API keys must be securely stored, not hardcoded
* **Performance:** Memory usage must be controlled during long conversations

### 6.2. Assumptions

* System is for internal testing or small-scale prototype use
* Prompt files and behavior definitions will remain prompt-based initially

## 7. Technology Stack (Preferences/Mandates)

* **Mandatory:** Python 3.x, OpenAI GPT-4 API
* **Preferred:** `asyncio`, `pytest`, `python-dotenv`
* **To Be Researched by Swarm:** Best practices for agent orchestration and interaction modeling

## 8. Success Metrics (For V1)

* 100% of code under test with unit and integration tests
* Refactor completed with 4+ core classes and zero global state
* GPT API response handling resilient to 3 types of failure (rate limit, timeout, network)
* Configurable windowing and output file logging tested and functional

## 9. Key Stakeholders

* **Project Sponsor:** Head of Applied AI Prototyping
* **Product Owner:** Technical Product Manager
* **Lead Developer/Swarm Overseer:** Lead AI Software Engineer

## 10. Existing Resources & Documentation

* Preliminary prototype script (`sim3.py`)
* Agent prompt definition files (`chatbot6.txt`, `chatbot7.txt`)

## 11. Open Questions & Areas for Swarm Research

* What are best practices for modeling AI agents with behavior and memory?
* What conversation topologies beyond turn-taking should be supported?
* How should agent prompts be abstracted to allow reuse and experimentation?
* What are the recommended libraries or patterns for GPT API retries and fallbacks?
* How can asynchronous testing (e.g., API mocks) be made robust and portable?
