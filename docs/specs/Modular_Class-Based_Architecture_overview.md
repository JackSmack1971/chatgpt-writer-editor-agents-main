# Feature Overview Specification: Modular Class-Based Architecture

## 1. Feature Summary

This specification defines the "Modular Class-Based Architecture" feature for the refactored ChatGPT Writer/Editor Agent System. The goal is to transform the existing monolithic Python script into a modular, maintainable, and scalable object-oriented architecture, supporting extensibility, testability, and future feature growth. The design must adhere to Python best practices and maintain a strict separation of concerns.

---

## 2. User Stories

- **As a developer**, I want a `Chatbot` class to encapsulate each agent's logic and conversation history, so that agent behaviors are reusable and independently testable.
- **As a developer**, I want an `OpenAIClient` class to abstract all GPT API interactions, so that API logic is decoupled from agent logic and can be easily mocked for testing.
- **As a developer**, I want a `ConversationManager` class to orchestrate multi-agent conversations, so that conversation flows are flexible and extensible.
- **As a developer**, I want a `ConfigManager` (or similar) class to securely load and manage configuration and API keys, so that sensitive data is not hardcoded and the system is easily configurable.
- **As a product owner**, I want the system to be fully covered by unit and integration tests, so that regressions are caught early and the codebase is reliable.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

- The codebase is refactored into at least four core classes: `Chatbot`, `OpenAIClient`, `ConversationManager`, and `ConfigManager` (or equivalent).
- Each class has a single, well-defined responsibility (SRP).
- There is zero use of global state; all state is encapsulated within class instances.
- All API keys and configuration values are loaded securely from environment variables or config files.
- The system supports asynchronous OpenAI API calls using `asyncio`.
- Conversation history is managed with windowing (configurable in-memory message limit) and persistent logging to disk.
- 100% test coverage is achieved using `pytest`, including tests with a mock GPT client.
- The architecture supports future extension (e.g., new agent types, memory modules, conversation topologies) without major refactoring.
- The code adheres to Python best practices (PEP8, type hints, docstrings).

## 4. Functional Requirements

- **Class Structure**
  - Implement `Chatbot` class for agent logic and history.
  - Implement `OpenAIClient` class for all GPT API interactions.
  - Implement `ConversationManager` class for orchestrating agent interactions.
  - Implement `ConfigManager` (or similar) for configuration and secrets management.
- **Asynchronous Operations**
  - All API calls must be non-blocking and support robust error handling (rate limits, timeouts, network errors).
- **Memory and Logging**
  - In-memory conversation windowing (configurable message limit).
  - Persistent logging of full conversation history to disk.
- **Testing**
  - Provide unit and integration tests for all classes.
  - Use mock API clients for offline testing.
- **Extensibility**
  - Design for easy addition of new agent types, memory modules, and conversation flows.
  - Decouple prompt templates from agent logic.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Maintainability:** Code must be readable, well-documented, and modular.
- **Scalability:** Architecture must support future growth (e.g., multi-agent, advanced memory).
- **Security:** No hardcoded secrets; secure handling of API keys.
- **Performance:** Efficient memory usage, especially for long-running conversations.
- **Testability:** 100% code coverage with automated tests.

## 6. Scope Definition

### In Scope
- Refactoring into modular, class-based architecture with at least four core classes.
- Secure configuration and environment management.
- Asynchronous OpenAI API handling.
- Conversation windowing and persistent logging.
- Full test suite with mock API support.

### Out of Scope (V1)
- Web or GUI interface.
- Support for non-GPT models.
- Real-time multi-user support.
- Integration with external databases or message brokers.
- Advanced NLP customization beyond prompt engineering.

## 7. Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- OpenAI GPT-4 API
- `asyncio` for async operations
- `pytest` for testing
- `python-dotenv` or similar for environment management

---

## 8. High-Level Design Notes

- **Separation of Concerns:** Each class must have a single responsibility, following SRP.
- **Extensibility:** Use composition and clear interfaces to allow new agent types, memory modules, or conversation topologies.
- **Memory Modeling:** Follow best practices from LangChain and similar frameworks (e.g., buffer memory, vector store memory, memory checkpointing).
- **Prompt Abstraction:** Keep prompt templates decoupled from agent logic for easy experimentation.
- **No Global State:** All state must be encapsulated within class instances.

## 9. Open Questions & Risks (Knowledge Gaps)

Based on research/03_analysis/knowledge_gaps.md, the following knowledge gaps and risks are identified:

- **Agent Memory Scalability:** Uncertainty about the performance limits of in-memory vector stores for long-running or multi-user scenarios. Strategies for sharding, pruning, or offloading memory may be needed in future versions.
- **Advanced Conversation Topologies:** Best practices for supporting dynamic or pluggable conversation flows (beyond turn-taking) are not fully established.
- **Prompt Template Management:** Effective strategies for versioning and experimenting with prompt templates in collaborative environments remain an open question.
- **API Rate Limit Handling:** Robust patterns for distributed rate limit coordination and fallback under high concurrency are not fully validated.
- **Async Testing Tooling:** Limitations exist in current async test coverage and mocking tools for complex agent systems.
- **Security for API Keys:** Best practices for secret rotation and audit logging in local/dev Python projects require further research.

- Zero global state in the codebase.
- 100% test coverage (unit and integration) with `pytest`.
- All configuration and secrets loaded securely from environment or config files.
- System is easily extensible for future features.

## 12. Reflection & Next Steps

This specification provides a comprehensive foundation for refactoring the ChatGPT Writer/Editor Agent System into a modular, class-based architecture. It incorporates requirements elicitation, user story mapping, acceptance criteria definition, scope definition, and dependency identification, while explicitly referencing open knowledge gaps and risks. The next steps include detailed class/interface design, implementation, and continuous validation against the outlined success metrics.
