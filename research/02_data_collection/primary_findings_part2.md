## Best Practices for Conversation Topologies Beyond Turn-Taking

### 1. Multi-Agent and Group Conversation Patterns

- **DialogueAgent and DialogueSimulator:** Use modular agent classes (`DialogueAgent`) and a simulator/orchestrator (`DialogueSimulator`) to manage conversations between multiple agents. Each agent maintains its own message history and can send/receive messages independently.
- **Speaker Selection Strategies:** Move beyond strict round-robin turn-taking by implementing:
  - **Director/Moderator Agent:** A special agent (e.g., `DirectorDialogueAgent`) selects the next speaker based on conversation context, agent roles, or randomization.
  - **Bidding/Decentralized Selection:** Agents can "bid" for the right to speak, with the orchestrator selecting the highest bidder, enabling more dynamic and context-sensitive flows.
  - **Custom Selection Functions:** Use pluggable selection functions to support arbitrary conversation topologies (e.g., random, priority-based, or context-driven).

### 2. Threaded and Parallel Conversations

- **Thread IDs:** Use unique thread or session IDs in agent configuration to manage multiple concurrent or parallel conversations, supporting multi-user or multi-session scenarios.
- **StateGraph/Workflow Models:** Model conversation flows as state graphs, where nodes represent conversation states or agent actions, and edges define possible transitions. This supports both linear and non-linear flows, including branching, looping, and group interactions.

### 3. Non-Linear and Directed Flows

- **Directed Conversations:** Implement director or moderator agents to guide the flow, inject new topics, or terminate conversations based on context or probability.
- **Group and Debate Formats:** Support debate, panel, or group discussion formats by configuring agents with roles, tools, and custom prompts.

### 4. Extensibility and Modularity

- **Agent Roles and Prompts:** Assign distinct roles, system messages, and toolsets to each agent for richer, more realistic group interactions.
- **Pluggable Topologies:** Design the conversation orchestrator to accept different topology strategies, making it easy to experiment with new formats.

### 5. Code Patterns

- **DialogueAgent/Simulator Example:**
  ```python
  class DialogueAgent:
      ...
      def send(self) -> str:
          # Generate message based on history and system prompt
          ...
      def receive(self, name: str, message: str) -> None:
          # Update message history
          ...

  class DialogueSimulator:
      ...
      def step(self) -> tuple[str, str]:
          # Select next speaker, send message, broadcast to all agents
          ...
  ```
- **Director Agent Example:**
  ```python
  class DirectorDialogueAgent(DialogueAgent):
      ...
      def _choose_next_speaker(self) -> str:
          # Use prompt or logic to select next speaker
          ...
  ```
- **Threaded Conversation Example:**
  ```python
  config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "abc123"}}
  output = app.invoke({"messages": input_messages}, config)
  ```

### 6. Practical Recommendations

- **Start with DialogueAgent/Simulator for modularity.**
- **Use director or bidding patterns for advanced flows.**
- **Leverage thread IDs and state graphs for scalability and parallelism.**
- **Design for extensibility: allow easy swapping of topology strategies.**
