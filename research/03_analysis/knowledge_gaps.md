# Knowledge Gaps and Areas for Further Research

This document identifies remaining uncertainties, open issues, and areas where further research or validation may be beneficial, based on the initial findings for the NewProject_Alpha refactor.

## 1. Agent Memory Scalability and Performance
- What are the practical performance limits of vector store memory (e.g., InMemoryVectorStore) for long-running, multi-user agent systems?
- Are there recommended strategies for sharding, pruning, or offloading memory to persistent storage in local/dev environments?

## 2. Advanced Conversation Topologies
- What are the best practices for dynamically switching between conversation topologies (e.g., from turn-taking to group debate) at runtime?
- How can conversation orchestration be made fully pluggable for experimentation without introducing excessive complexity?

## 3. Prompt Template Versioning and Experimentation
- What are the most effective strategies for managing and versioning prompt templates in a collaborative development environment?
- Are there tools or frameworks that support prompt A/B testing and rollback?

## 4. API Rate Limit Handling in High-Concurrency Scenarios
- How do retry and fallback strategies scale under high concurrency and strict OpenAI rate limits?
- Are there open-source patterns for distributed rate limit coordination in local/dev setups?

## 5. Async Testing Coverage and Tooling
- What are the current limitations of pytest-asyncio and related tools for coverage reporting and debugging in complex async agent systems?
- Are there best practices for mocking streaming and batch async LLM calls in a way that is both robust and portable?

## 6. Security and Compliance for Local API Key Management
- What are the most secure patterns for managing OpenAI API keys in local/dev environments, especially for collaborative teams?
- Are there recommended tools for secret rotation and audit logging in Python projects?

**Next Steps:**
- Targeted research on the above knowledge gaps, prioritizing scalability, security, and advanced orchestration.
- Validation of findings with real-world benchmarks or case studies, if available.
- Continuous update of this document as new gaps are identified or resolved.
