# Key Research Questions

This document lists the primary research questions driving the refactoring of the GPT-4 agent conversation system, as well as any additional questions identified during scoping.

## Open Questions from Project Blueprint

1. **What are best practices for modeling AI agents with behavior and memory?**
2. **What conversation topologies beyond turn-taking should be supported?**
3. **How should agent prompts be abstracted to allow reuse and experimentation?**
4. **What are the recommended libraries or patterns for GPT API retries and fallbacks?**
5. **How can asynchronous testing (e.g., API mocks) be made robust and portable?**

## Additional Research Questions

6. What are the most effective modularization patterns for Python-based agent systems?
7. How can secure configuration and API key management be enforced in local/dev environments?
8. What are the best practices for conversation windowing and memory control in long-running agent systems?
9. How can comprehensive test coverage be achieved for asynchronous, API-driven Python code?
10. What are the most common failure modes in OpenAI API usage, and how can they be mitigated?

## Prioritization

The first five questions are prioritized as "must-answer" for the initial research cycle, as they directly address the project's open research needs. Additional questions will be addressed as time and resources allow, or as they become relevant during recursive research cycles.
