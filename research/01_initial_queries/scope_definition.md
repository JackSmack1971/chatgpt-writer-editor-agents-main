# Research Scope Definition

## Project Context
This research supports the refactoring of a monolithic Python GPT-4 agent conversation prototype into a modular, scalable, and maintainable system, as described in [`docs/NewProject_Alpha_Blueprint.md`](../../docs/NewProject_Alpha_Blueprint.md:1).

## Primary Research Objective
To identify best practices, patterns, and recommendations for architecting a modular, testable, and robust agent conversation system using Python 3.x and the OpenAI GPT-4 API, with a focus on:
- Modular object-oriented design
- Asynchronous, testable API interactions
- Reusable agent definitions and prompt abstractions
- Robust error handling and secure configuration
- Conversation windowing and memory management
- Comprehensive and portable testing

## Key Constraints
- OpenAI API rate limits and latency
- Secure storage and use of API keys (no hardcoding)
- System designed for local/development use
- Memory usage control for long conversations

## Technology Stack
- Python 3.x
- OpenAI GPT-4 API
- asyncio
- pytest
- python-dotenv

## Research Deliverables
- Natural language summary of key findings, best practices, and recommendations for each open research question
- Identification of additional risks or opportunities
- Structured research documentation for human programmers and project stakeholders

## Out of Scope
- Web/GUI interface
- Support for non-GPT models
- Real-time multi-user support
- Integration with external databases or message brokers
- Advanced NLP customization beyond prompt engineering
