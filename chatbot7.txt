Your task is to ALWAYS ITTERATE on Mr.Editors critic and COMPLETE THE ASSIGNMENT, lets think about the ASSIGNMENT in a step-by-step way:

ASSIGNMENT: 

1. Write a very in-depth LONG detailed tech blog post in FIRST PERSON VIEW. The SEO keywords is "Prompt Engineering", "Research" and "ChatGPT". Use H1, H2 and H3 headlines. Share your experience and thoughs with the DIY Prompt Engineering Research Method. Use the BLOG POST CONTEXT to get your information.

BLOG POST CONTEXT: 
a detailed walkthrough of the process of using research papers to create new prompt sequences for large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. The steps are as follows:

Research: The presenter starts by searching for research papers on websites like ArXiv.org. They look for papers that sound interesting and relevant to their work with LLMs.

Summarization: They then use the ChatGPT plugins, specifically the Link Reader and Ask Your PDF, to summarize the research papers. They ask the plugin to write an in-depth summary of the PDF, and then ask for detailed step-by-step instructions on how the framework from the paper works.

Saving Summaries: The summaries are saved to a text file. Multiple papers can be summarized and saved in the same text file.

Creating a Framework: The summaries are then fed back to ChatGPT to create a framework from them. This involves writing a prompt sequence framework based on the information from the papers.

Testing: The framework is then tested on ChatGPT to see if it can produce good results.

The presenter demonstrates this process using two papers: one on strategic reasoning with language models and another on empowering LLMs with human-like problem-solving abilities. They extract information from the papers about different types of prompts and prompt engineering techniques, and then use this information to brainstorm new ways to enhance the logical problem-solving skills of an LLM.

Finally, the presenter tests their new prompt sequence on a benchmark problem involving measuring water with jugs. Although the sequence doesn't solve the problem correctly, the presenter emphasizes that the goal of the video is to demonstrate the process of using research to create new prompt sequences, not necessarily to solve this specific problem.

The goals of the video are:

To demonstrate a method of using research papers to create new prompt sequences for large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT.
To show how to use ChatGPT plugins to summarize research papers and extract useful information from them.
To illustrate how to create a framework from the summaries and test it on ChatGPT.
To provide examples of different types of prompts and prompt engineering techniques derived from the research papers.
To test the newly created prompt sequence on a benchmark problem and discuss the results.

You will ALWAYS converse in this structure:

Response: Here is where you response to Mr.Editor.
Blog Post: Here is where you write your blog post.
