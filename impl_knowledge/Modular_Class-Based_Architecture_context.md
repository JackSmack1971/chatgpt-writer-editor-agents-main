# Modular_Class-Based_Architecture: Implementation Knowledge Context

## Summary of TDD Test Scaffold

As of this cycle, comprehensive pytest-based test stubs have been created for all four core classes required by the Modular_Class-Based_Architecture feature:

- `Chatbot`: Covers instantiation, async message sending/receiving, memory integration (buffer/vector), prompt template usage, error handling (invalid memory, missing prompt, corrupted history), boundary (window size, empty conversation), and extensibility (new memory modules).
- `OpenAIClient`: Covers async prompt completion, secure API key loading, error handling (rate limit, network, invalid key, malformed response), batch/streaming async calls, retries/fallbacks, and boundary conditions.
- `ConversationManager`: Covers orchestration of multiple Chatbots, session/thread management, persistent logging, error handling (invalid agent list, corrupted session/log), boundary (max sessions, empty agent list), and extensibility (pluggable topologies).
- `ConfigManager`: Covers secure config loading from env/file, secret retrieval, error handling (missing/invalid config), secret rotation, security (no hardcoded secrets), and environment variable isolation.

All tests use dummy/mock classes for dependencies and are structured for pytest and pytest-asyncio, as required by the test plan and architecture.

## Design Decisions

- All state is instance-based; no global state is used in any test or class stub.
- Dummy memory modules and prompt templates are used to enable isolated testing of Chatbot logic.
- Async methods are used throughout, with pytest-asyncio for all async test cases.
- Error and boundary conditions are explicitly tested for each class.
- Extensibility is validated by allowing new memory modules, pluggable topologies, and secret rotation.

## Open Questions (from knowledge gaps and research)

- What are the practical performance limits of in-memory vector stores for long-running/multi-user scenarios? (Scalability and persistence strategies remain open.)
- What are best practices for dynamic/pluggable conversation topologies and orchestration? (How to support experimentation without excessive complexity.)
- How should prompt template versioning and experimentation be managed in collaborative environments? (A/B testing, rollback, and version control.)
- What are robust patterns for distributed API rate limit coordination under high concurrency? (Retry/fallback strategies and open-source solutions.)
- What are the current limitations of async test coverage and mocking tools for complex agent systems? (Coverage reporting, streaming/batch mocking.)
- What are the most secure patterns for API key management, secret rotation, and audit logging in local/dev Python projects?

## Implementation Challenges

- Ensuring all async and error handling paths are covered in tests, especially for streaming and batch operations.
- Designing testable interfaces for memory modules and prompt templates, given the need for extensibility and decoupling.
- Mocking external dependencies (OpenAI API, config) robustly for offline and deterministic testing.
- Maintaining strict separation of concerns and no global state, as required by the architecture.
- **NEW (Cycle 3): Test Isolation Challenge:** Some test fixtures (notably in `tests/test_chatbot.py`) define and use local dummy class implementations (e.g., `Chatbot`), rather than the actual implementation in `chatbot.py`. This means that changes to the real class do not affect test outcomes for those tests. This is a persistent challenge for TDD progress and must be addressed for true integration and coverage. Recommend updating test fixtures to use the real class for all integration and error-handling tests.

## Recommendations for Next Cycle

- Implement the actual class skeletons and interfaces in the codebase, ensuring all tests fail as expected (red phase of TDD).
- Incrementally implement class logic to pass the tests, starting with the simplest cases.
- Continuously update this knowledge context with new findings, design decisions, and resolved knowledge gaps.
- Monitor for any new requirements or constraints from project signals or documentation updates.
- **NEW (Cycle 3):** Review and refactor test fixtures to ensure they use the actual implementation classes, not local dummy classes, for all tests that are meant to validate integration and error handling.

## Implementation Cycle Update (TDD Cycle 3: Minimal Logic & Test Integration)

**Summary of Work:**
- Minimal logic implemented in all four core classes to pass instantiation and attribute presence tests.
- `Chatbot.send_message` updated to raise `TypeError` if `history` is `None`, but test still fails due to use of local dummy class in test fixture.
- `ConfigManager.get` updated to check `os.environ` first, then file config, but test still fails due to test logic and teardown sequence.
- Key finding: Some tests are not using the real implementation, blocking further TDD progress for error-handling and integration cases.

**Persistent Challenges / Open Questions:**
- Test isolation and fixture usage: Need to ensure tests use the actual implementation for integration and error-handling validation.
- No new technical blockers for code logic, but test harness requires refactor for full TDD cycle.

**Recommendations:**
- Proceed to refactor test fixtures to use the real implementation classes.
- Continue to update this context file after each major implementation or test cycle.
- Monitor for any new requirements or constraints from project signals or documentation updates.

This context file should be updated after each major implementation or test cycle. It provides a traceable record of design intent, open questions, and implementation progress for the Modular_Class-Based_Architecture feature.
## Debugging Intervention: TDD Cycle 3 Test Fixture Refactor (May 17, 2025)

**Diagnosis:**  
Persistent failures in `TestChatbot.test_corrupted_history` and `TestConfigManager.test_env_var_isolation` were traced to the use of local dummy class implementations in test fixtures, rather than the actual implementation classes. This prevented changes in the real code from affecting test outcomes, blocking true integration and error-handling validation.

**Actions Taken:**  
- Refactored `tests/test_chatbot.py` to import and use the real `Chatbot` class in the `chatbot` fixture. Dummy memory and prompt template classes are still used for isolation, but the core logic is now validated against the actual implementation.
- Refactored `tests/test_config_manager.py` to import and use the real `ConfigManager` class in the `config_manager` fixture. The fixture now passes the simulated `.env` file to the real implementation, ensuring environment variable and file-based config logic is properly tested.

**Impact:**  
- Tests now exercise the real implementation, enabling accurate validation of integration and error-handling logic.
- This resolves the persistent TDD blocker and aligns the test harness with best practices for modular, class-based architectures.

**Persistent/Anticipated Challenges:**  
- If the real implementation diverges from the dummy logic, new failures may surface, requiring incremental fixes in the actual code.
- Test isolation and teardown logic (especially for environment variables) should be monitored for side effects across tests.

**Recommendations for Next Cycle:**  
- Run the full test suite and address any new failures that arise from the now-correct integration tests.
- Continue to ensure all fixtures use the real implementation classes for integration and error-handling validation.
- Maintain this knowledge context with updates after each major implementation or test cycle.
